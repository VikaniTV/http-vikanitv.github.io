    One Piece is a timeless masterpiece, considering it's 25 years of production.<br />

    But if we're being serious, its rather difficult to explain one's love for the saga of the stretchy-kid.
    He's adventures rely on the pure joy of exploration and search for freedom. <br />
    Althought, this is the original reason, he's always stopping here and there to help a new oe old friend. <br />
    He's kindness, honesty and purety makes one fall in love with the journey and wish to follow him anywhere. <br />
    I think that as espectators, we enjoy a small piece of what it is to be around our main character. <br /> <hr />
